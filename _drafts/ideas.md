MathJax Reference:

Inline MathJax: \\(\mathbf{y} = A \mathbf{x}\\) or $$\cfrac{d}{dt}\cfrac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = \cfrac{\partial L}{\partial q}$$

Separate by a blank line to start math on a new line: 

$$\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
A & = \frac{\pi r^2}{2} \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}$$
