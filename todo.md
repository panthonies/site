MathJax Reference:

		Inline MathJax: \\(\mathbf{y} = A \mathbf{x}\\) or $$\cfrac{d}{dt}\cfrac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = \cfrac{\partial L}{\partial q}$$

		Separate by a blank line to start math on a new line: 

		$$\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
		\begin{split}
		A & = \frac{\pi r^2}{2} \\
		 & = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}$$
