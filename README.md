# Welcome! 

This repository contains the files that make up my personal website and contains three branches:

1. **master**, the default branch; I don't use it often so it may be a couple of commits behind
2. **gh-pages**, the branch used to publish the site to Github Pages
3. **chalk**, the branch I primarily use to work on updates to the website

The website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The theme is [Chalk](http://chalk.nielsenramon.com), built by Nielsen Ramon, and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/nielsenramon/chalk).
