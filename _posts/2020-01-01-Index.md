:balloon: <span style = "color:black">Welcome to my blog! You can find an organized directory of my posts on this page. </span>:balloon:

I have a couple of personal posts in the "Just for Fun" section below, but the majority of my effort has gone toward taking notes on the statistics and programming textbooks that I have been reading recently. I've found that writing these notes helps solidify my knowledge and serves as a useful reference in the likely scenario that I want to refer back to the information.
