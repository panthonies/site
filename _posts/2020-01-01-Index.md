Yes. I wanted to make this website minimal and easy to navigate, so there are only two main pages: the home page, which provides an introduction, and this blog index, which links out to everything else.

I have a couple of personal posts in the "Just for Fun" section below (along with the few Kaggle competitions I've entered), but the majority of my effort has gone toward taking notes on the statistics and programming textbooks that I have been reading. I've found that writing these notes helps solidify my knowledge and serves as a useful reference in the likely scenario that I want to refer back to the information.

###### This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="blank"} and hosted on Github Pages in [this repository](https://github.com/panthonies/site/tree/chalk){:target="blank"}.

I've made a number of changes to the [original theme](http://chalk.nielsenramon.com){:target="blank"} in order to keep the site minimalistic and easy on the eyes.
