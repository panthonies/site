[This post is in progress.]

In this post we'll be taking a look at basic data transformation in R -- namely, six important R functions included in the code(dplyr) package:[^1]

[^1]: This post is meant for a person who is looking for a refresher on the basics of the dplyr package. The content in this post is based on chapter four of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund, which I would recommend reading for a more thorough explanation.

* {% ihighlight r %}filter(){% endihighlight %} - filter rows
* {% ihighlight r %}arrange(){% endihighlight %} - order rows
* {% ihighlight r %}select(){% endihighlight %} - select columns
* {% ihighlight r %}mutate(){% endihighlight %} - transform and create variables
* {% ihighlight r %}group_by(){% endihighlight %} - group data
* {% ihighlight r %}summarize(){% endihighlight %} - summarize data

**First things first:** Here is the [RStudio Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf), if that's what you're looking for.

## Filter





## Arrange
