In this post we'll be taking a look at...[^1]

[^1]: This post is meant for a person who is looking for a refresher on the very basics of the dplyr package (i.e., me when I inevitably forget how to summarize data). The content in this post is based on chapter five of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund, which I would recommend reading for a more thorough explanation.

These functions will help you scratch the surface of manipulating datasets.

**First things first:** Here is the [RStudio Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf), if that's what you're looking for.
