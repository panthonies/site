## Q: How are your website and blog organized?

I wanted to make this website minimal and easy to navigate, so there are only two main pages on this site: the **home page**, which provides an introduction, and the **blog index**, which links out to everything else.

My blog has two main sections:

1. The "Just for Fun" section has some fun posts about myself, along with detailed write-ups of Kaggle data science competitions that I've entered.
2. The "Reference Material" section has notes on textbooks that I've read recently. I've found that writing these notes helps solidify my knowledge and serves as a useful reference.


## Q: How is this website built?

###### This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="blank"} and hosted on Github Pages in [this repository](https://github.com/panthonies/site/tree/chalk){:target="blank"}.

I've made a number of changes to the [original theme](http://chalk.nielsenramon.com){:target="blank"} in order to keep the site minimalistic and easy on the eyes.
