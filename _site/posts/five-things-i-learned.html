            <p>I worked at a large technology company in a technical, customer-facing role for three years after I graduated from college. Here are the most important lessons I've taken from my experience.</p>

            <p>To past me, from future me – some words of advice.</p>

<h2 id="1-write-clear-emails">1. Write clear emails.</h2>

<p>A well-written email will establish goodwill for yourself, bring others in to your perspective, and save both time and energy in the long run.</p>

<p>Before you write an email, know the context of the situation. <span style="background-color: #ffe9d6">Ask yourself this: who holds power in this situation, and what are the expectations from all parties coming into the conversation?</span> Then, figure out what information you need to include and which expectations you need to set in order to meet your own goals.</p>

<p>People have short attention spans, and work emails are not a great medium to include subtle implications. If you want something to happen, then <span style="background-color: #ffe9d6">be very direct</span> or else it will be misunderstood.</p>

<p>On a similar note, <span style="background-color: #ffe9d6">keep it simple.</span> No one wants to read paragraphs that are more than four lines long, unless they’re already expecting to dive deep into the details on a shared project. If you find yourself writing a longer email than you were expecting, a quick 5-10 minute phone call goes a long way.</p>

<p>Speaking of phone calls: know when to call it quits with email. It’s useful to have a written record of communication, but if you’re constrained by a deadline, it is worth calling or even visiting someone in person to make sure something gets done.</p>

<h2 id="2-listen-attentively-speak-confidently-and-act-decisively">2. Listen attentively, speak confidently, and act decisively.</h2>

<p>When presented with a question, always make sure to listen and ask questions until you fully understand the situation. Again, keep the context in mind: know who you’re talking to and what’s important to them.</p>

<p>I’m often filled with a paralyzing need to find The Perfect Answer™, but I’ve began to accept that nothing I’m working on will be absolutely perfect – while there are right and wrong answers when you’re doing homework or taking a test for school, the lines are often blurred when working for a company. <span style="background-color: #ffe9d6">It’s absolutely okay to be uncertain about the conclusions you’ve come to, but it’s important to confidently communicate where that uncertainty comes from and establish the best path forward when tackling a problem.</span> Don’t be afraid to say you don’t know an answer and ask to follow-up on it later.</p>

<p>If you need to act, then do it decisively.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Trust that you’ve made the best decision with the information you have. If you’re proven wrong, no worries – just adapt to the new knowledge you’ve been given and move on. It’ll inspire confidence and trust from those around you.</p>

<h2 id="3-set-aside-time-to-learn-and-experiment">3. Set aside time to learn and experiment.</h2>

<p>I am a strong believer that low-stakes, unstructured “play” time is the best way to grow your curiosity and learn.</p>

<p>At a full-time job, it can be hard to find time for yourself, especially when you’re running from meeting to meeting on a tight schedule and struggling to get your work done. <span style="background-color: #ffe9d6">Be deliberate about setting boundaries so that you’re able to work in a way that suits you best; ultimately, a better environment for youself leads to happier and more productive work.</span></p>

<p>I find it important to make a space for myself with no expectations to produce anything of value, so I can experiment (and fail!) with new ideas. In this way, I’m able to take a break from higher-stress work, learn, and recharge at the same time by following my curiosity wherever it takes me.</p>

<h2 id="4-make-decisions-for-the-long-term">4. Make decisions for the long-term.</h2>

<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day tasks and drama of a workplace environment, but make sure to <span style="background-color: #ffe9d6">put the decisions you make for the short term in perspective of the long run.</span></p>

<p>Before you send an angry email, think about whether you’ll regret sending it a month later.</p>

<p>Before you make decisions about taking (or not taking) on an extra project, think about whether it’s consistent with your goals.</p>

<p>Before you complain to your colleagues or manager, think about the kind of self-image you’re projecting and how it’ll impact your relationships.</p>

<h2 id="5-find-joy-outside-of-work">5. Find joy outside of work.</h2>

<p>Sure – work can be fulfilling, but it can also suck. At its best, you are making a real difference in the lives of other people, and at its worst, you are a cog of a capitalist machine that values you only for your ability to create profits which will then be distributed in a system that entrenches power for those who already hold it.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #ffe9d6">Make sure to take care of yourself by finding activities that you enjoy and participating in those activities.</span> Remind yourself that there are small joys in life, and moments of beauty that make you smile.</p>
